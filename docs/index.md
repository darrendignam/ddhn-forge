Developed in collaboration with the Dutch Digital Heritage Network, ViPER is an easy-to-install virtual machine running popular open source preservation tools with graphical user interfaces: DROID, HandBrake, JHOVE, MediaConch, Mediainfo, Tika and veraPDF. With this VRE we aim to reduce barriers to using and testing digital preservation software.

With a selection of open source digital preservation tools pre-installed, it enables users to try out tools typically used in the pre-ingest and ingest stages of a digital preservation workflow, without having to install or configure the software. You can research them before making decisions about which to use in your production environment.

ViPER is now maintained by the Open Preservation Foundation.
